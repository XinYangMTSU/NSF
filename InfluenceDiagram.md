* BBN is a `probabilistic graphical model` (PGM)
* `Nodes` are the features
* `Edges/Links` represent relations between features.

| BBN     | Pros          | Cons  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|    | Can calculate explicit probabilities for hypotheses | Require initial knowledge of many probabilities |
|    | Prior knowledge can be incrementally) combined with newer knowledge to better approximate perfect knowledge | Can become computationally intractable |
